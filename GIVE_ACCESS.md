## Give access
After running the program you will need to open System Preferences and go to *Security & Privacy > Accessibility*. Click the lock in the bottom left to make changes. 

<div align="center">
    <img src=".github/assets/lock.png" width="50%">
</div>

Click the + sign

<div align="center">
    <img src=".github/assets/plus.png" width="50%">
</div>

Then find the location of the Application in the finder window and double click on it.

## Possible problems
Sometimes you'll need to remove Tajpi from the *Security & Privacy > Accessibility* menu and add it back again.
