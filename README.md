# Tajpi
A macos clone of the windows program [Tajpi](http://www.zz9pza.net/tajpi/en/) that lets you type esperanto letters by holding down the alt-gr key.

## How to use
Tajpi will appear as an icon in the menu bar. If you click on it, you'll be greeted with a settings interface. To type an esperanto letter press and hold the option key as you press down either c g h j s u and they will transform into ĉ ĝ ĥ ĵ ŝ ŭ
## Possible problems
Tajpi won't work without enabled accessability permissions. Double check that permissions are set. If you've downloaded a new version, you might need to remove tajpi from the list and add it again by pressing the "-" sign at the bottom left of the ui.
